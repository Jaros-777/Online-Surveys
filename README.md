Use Ctrl + F9 or click the build icon (the little hammer 🔨) 
 
- Run the Spring Boot application.  
Just hit the green "▶️" next to the main class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation  
  
By default, the server runs on port 8080:

Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal:  
```  
cd OnlineSurvey-Frontend
```  
Install dependencies (if not already installed):  
```  
npm install
```  
Start the development server:  
```  
npm run dev
```  
Vite runs on port 5173 by default.  
Open your browser and go to:
