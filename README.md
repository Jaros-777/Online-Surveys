- Sharing a link to a survey  
- Collecting and previewing results

## 🚀 Purpose of the project  
The project serves an educational purpose - it's a testing ground for learning modern web technologies, client-server architecture and creating full-fledged CRUD applications.

### 🛠️ Step 1: Backend – Spring Boot

(You can use another IDE)  
  
- Build the project if needed.  
Use Ctrl + F9 or click the build icon (the little hammer 🔨) 
 
- Run the Spring Boot application.  
Just hit the green "▶️" next to the main class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation  
  
By default, the server runs on port 8080:

Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal:  
```  
cd OnlineSurvey-Frontend
```

```  
npm install
```  
Start the development server:  
```  
npm run dev

Open your browser and go to:
