## 🧑‍💻 For testing in develompent:   
### 🛠️ Step 1: Backend – Spring Boot  
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.  
(You can use another IDE)  
  
- Build the project if needed.  
Use Ctrl + F9 or click the build icon (the little hammer 🔨) 
 
- Run the Spring Boot application.  
Just hit the green "▶️" next to the main class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation  
  
By default, the server runs on port 8080:  
👉 http://localhost:8080
